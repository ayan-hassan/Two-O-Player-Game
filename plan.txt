Create a 2-Player math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they mis-answer a question. At the end of every turn, the game should output the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.

The game doesn’t end until one of the players loses all their lives. At this point, the game should announce who won and what the other player’s score is.

Potential Classes:
  - players: will hold player data and their scores/lives
  - mathProblems: hold questions and answers, game loop, 
Methods:
  add/subtract points: if response != answer subtract 1 point from score. Once score = 0, exit game; parameter is user response
  calculate answer: add two inputted number from 1 - 20 (validate that it's within range as well); parameter are two numbers chosen, output is answer

  random number generator:
